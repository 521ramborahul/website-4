<p>When sharing Pattern Lab with a client it may be beneficial to turn-off certain elements in the default navigation. To turn-off navigation elements simply add their keys to the <code>ishControlsHide</code> option in <code>config/config.ini</code> and then re-generate the site. The following keys are supported and will hide their respective elements:</p>

<pre><code>s
m
l
full
random
disco
hay
mqs
find
views-all
views-annotations
views-code
views-new
tools-all
tools-follow
tools-reload
tools-shortcuts
tools-docs
</code></pre>
