<h1 id="auto-reloading-the-browser-window-when-changes-are-made">Auto Reloading the Browser Window When Changes Are Made</h1>

<p>Rather than manually refreshing your browser when your patterns or CSS change you can have the PHP version of Pattern Lab auto-reload your browser window for you. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-start-the-auto-reload-server">How to Start the Auto-Reload Server</h2>

<p>To start the service on Mac OS X you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <code>core/scripts/</code></li>
  <li>Double-click <code>startAutoReloadServer.command</code></li>
  <li>Refresh the Pattern Lab site</li>
</ol>

<p>For Linux and Windows users you can also start the service from the command line. To do so open your command prompt and navigate to the root of the patternlab-php directory. Type:</p>

<pre><code>php core/autoReloadServer.php
</code></pre>

<p>Your browser should now be listening for auto-reload events and the Pattern Lab website toolbar should note that “Auto-Reload” is now “On.” For this feature to work you <strong>must</strong> have the PHP version of Pattern Lab watching for changes. <a href="/docs/advanced-auto-regenerate.html">Learn how to set this up</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you find that content sync is not working properly please make sure your browser <a href="http://caniuse.com/websockets">supports WebSockets</a>.</p>
