<h1 id="adding-annotations">Adding Annotations</h1>

<p>Annotations provide an easy way to add notes to elements within a pattern and they can be found in <code>source/_data/annotations.js</code>. They’re <em>not</em> pattern-specific. Rather, they’re added to patterns using the same selector syntax you’d use for jQuery or CSS. </p>

<h2 id="explaining-annotations">Explaining Annotations</h2>

<p>To explain how annotations are structured here is the annotation that’s added to the logo:</p>

<p><code>
{
	"el": ".logo",
 	"title" : "Logo",
 	"comment": "The logo image is an SVG file, which ensures that the logo displays crisply even on high resolution displays. A PNG fallback is provided for browsers that don't support SVG images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further reading: &lt;a href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/hi-res-optimization/\"&gt;Optimizing Web Experiences for High Resolution Screens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
}
</code></p>

<p>Breaking down the JSON:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>el</strong> - the selector to be used to attach the annotation to a pattern</li>
  <li><strong>title</strong> - the title for a given annotation</li>
  <li><strong>comment</strong> - the description for a given annotation</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to make changes or additions to annotations simply edit the <code>annotations.js</code> file. Once your changes have been made just make sure your site has been re-generated.</p>
