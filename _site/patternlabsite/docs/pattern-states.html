<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Pattern states were introduced in v0.7.5 of the PHP version of Pattern Lab.</em></p>

<h1 id="using-pattern-states">Using Pattern States</h1>

<p>Pattern states provide your team and your client a simple visual of the current state of patterns in Pattern Lab. Pattern states can track progress of a pattern from development, through client review, to completion or they can be used to give certain patterns specific classes. It’s important to note that the state of a pattern can be influenced by its pattern partials.</p>

<h2 id="the-default-pattern-states">The Default Pattern States</h2>

<p>The PHP version of Pattern Lab comes with the following default pattern states:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inprogress</strong>: pattern is in development or being worked upon. a red dot.</li>
  <li><strong>inreview</strong>: pattern is ready for a client to look at and comment upon. a yellow dot.</li>
  <li><strong>complete</strong>: pattern is ready to be moved to production. a green dot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any pattern that includes a pattern partial that has a lower pattern state will inherit that state. For example, a pattern with the state of <code>inreview</code> that includes a pattern partial with the state of <code>inprogress</code> will have its state overridden and set to <code>inprogress</code>. It will not change to <code>inreview</code> until the pattern partial has a state of <code>inreview</code> or <code>complete</code>.</p>

<h2 id="giving-patterns-a-state">Giving Patterns a State</h2>

<p>Giving patterns a state is simply a matter of modifying the file name. If we wanted to give our <code>molecules-media-block</code> pattern a state of <code>inprogress</code> we’d change the file name from:</p>

<pre><code>source/_patterns/01-molecules/02-blocks/00-media-block.mustache
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>source/_patterns/01-molecules/02-blocks/00-media-block@inprogress.mustache
</code></pre>

<h2 id="adding-customized-states">Adding Customized States</h2>

<p>The three default states included with the PHP version of Pattern Lab might not be enough for everyone. To add customized states you should modify your own CSS files. <strong>DO NOT</strong> modify <code>states.css</code> in <code>public/styleguide/css/</code>. This is because <code>states.css</code> will be overwritten in future upgrades.</p>

<p>You can use the following as your CSS template for new pattern states:</p>

<pre><code>.newpatternstate:before {
    color: #B10DC9 !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then add <code>@newpatternstate</code> to your patterns to have the new look show up. If you want to add it to the cascade of the default patterns you can modify your <code>config.ini</code>. Simply add your new pattern state to the <code>patternStates</code> list.</p>
