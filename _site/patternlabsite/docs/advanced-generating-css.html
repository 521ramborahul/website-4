<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The <a href="https://github.com/dmolsen/css-rule-saver">CSS Rule Saver</a> library and CSS generation feature was added in v0.6.0 of the PHP version of Pattern Lab.</em></p>

<h1 id="generating-css">Generating CSS</h1>

<p>When using this feature, Pattern Lab can display only those CSS rules that affect a given pattern on the pattern detail view. This might be useful if you have a large Sass-generated CSS file or framework but only need a sub-set of styles that may affect a small piece of mark-up or pattern.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-generate-the-css">How to Generate the CSS</h2>

<p>To generate your Pattern Lab site with CSS support on Mac OS X you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <code>core/scripts/</code></li>
  <li>Double-click <code>generateSiteWithCSS.command</code></li>
  <li>Refresh the Pattern Lab site</li>
</ol>

<p>For Linux and Windows users you can also start the service from the command line. To do so open your command prompt and navigate to the root of the patternlab-php directory. Type:</p>

<pre><code>php core/builder.php -gc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="important-note-about-performance">Important Note About Performance</h2>

<p>It may take several seconds for the PHP version of Pattern Lab to generate a site when itâ€™s also calculating the CSS rules. Be patient.</p>
