<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The cleanPublic configuration option was introduced in v0.7.0 of the PHP version of Pattern Lab.</em></p>

<h1 id="stopping-public-from-being-cleaned">Stopping <code>public/</code> from Being “Cleaned”</h1>

<p>By default the PHP version of Pattern Lab deletes most of the files and directories found in <code>public/</code> when generating your site or starting the watch. Developers are supposed to use <code>source/</code> to store their files. This includes static assets like images, JavaScript and CSS. When generating your site the PHP version of Pattern Lab moves all of the static assets found in <code>source/</code> to <code>public/</code> (<em>after cleaning it</em>) so there shouldn’t be a reason not to use <code>source/</code>.</p>

<p>That said, developers might be more comfortable storing their static assets in <code>public/</code>. In order to turn-off the automatic <code>cleanPublic()</code> feature you can edit your configuration file. To do so do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <code>config/config.ini</code>.</li>
  <li>Change the <code>cleanPublic</code> from <code>"true"</code> to <code>"false"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>When you next generate your site or start the watch <code>public/</code> will no longer be cleaned.</p>
