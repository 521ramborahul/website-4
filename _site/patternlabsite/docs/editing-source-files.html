<h1 id="editing-pattern-lab-source-files">Editing Pattern Lab Source Files</h1>

<p>Because the PHP version of Pattern Lab is a static site generator you <u>**should not edit the files in the `public/` directory**</u>. Instead, you should edit the files under the <code>source/</code> directory. In addition to editing patterns under the <code>source/</code> directory youâ€™ll want to <a href="/docs/pattern-managing-assets.html">edit your JavaScript, CSS, and images</a> as well. Each time your site is generated your files will be automatically moved to the <code>public/</code> directory and the patterns will be automatically compiled.</p>

<p>Generating the Pattern Lab website after each change can be cumbersome. The PHP version of Pattern Lab comes with the ability to <a href="/docs/advanced-auto-regenerate.html">watch files in the <code>source/</code> directory for changes and re-generate the site automatically</a>. The Pattern Lab website can also be <a href="/docs/advanced-reload-browser.html">automatically reloaded</a>.</p>
