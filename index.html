				<h2>What</h2>
				Pattern Lab is a series of tools to create your very own custom atomic design system. Here's the <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">general gist</a>:

				<h3>What Pattern Lab Is</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>A static site generator</strong> &mdash; At its core, Pattern Lab is simply a way to construct an interface by stitching atoms, molecules, and organisms together to form templates and pages.</li>
					<li><strong>A comprehensive component library</strong> &mdash; Pattern Lab serves as your project's pattern library and frontend style guide. But it goes further as you're able to simulaneously see modules abstractly and in context. </li>
					<li><strong>A pattern starter kit</strong> &mdash;  Pattern Lab provides a whole slew of patterns to get started. <em>Don't use them all.</em> You should use Pattern Lab to establish your own atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Pattern Lab lets you write your HTML, CSS, and Javascript however you want.</li>
					<li><strong>A Viewport Resizer</strong> &mdash; It's our job to make sure our designs look and function beautifully across a whole slew of Web-enabled devices, even those that haven't been imagined yet. Pattern Lab provides a robust viewport resizing tool to helps you create great designs across all screen sizes, and also serves as a great educational tool for clients and team members.</li>
					<li><strong>An Annotation Tool (coming soon)</strong> &mdash; Pattern Lab provides a way to annotate patterns in order to communicate how the bits of your interface </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>What Pattern Lab Isn't</h3>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>A UI framework</strong> &mdash; Pattern Lab isn't Bootstrap. It's not Foundation. It's not flat. It's not skeumorphic. Pattern Lab provides the plumbing for creating design systems. How it looks and how it's coded is entirely up to you.</li>
					<li><strong>Language-dependent</strong> &mdash; Like Sass? Cool, go nuts with it. Like Less instead? That's cool too. Don't like any preprocessors at all? Totally fine. How about jQuery? Gotta have it or wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole? Pattern Lab lets you write HTML, CSS and JavaScript however want. Write code as awesome or as crappy as you like. Pattern Lab simply provides a scaffolding with which to stitch together your interface.</li>
					<li><strong>Incredibly Rigid</strong> &mdash; Pattern Lab is designed to be flexible with regards to naming and structure. There's really no One Right Way to do this, and we think that's just fine.</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="why">
				<h2>Why</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Tiny Bootstraps, for Every Client</p>
					<cite><a href="http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/" rel="external">Dave Rupert</a></cite>
				</blockquote>

				<p>This style guide keeps track of every module going onto the site, creates a shared vocabulary between everyone involved in the project, makes testing easier, establishes a better workflow,  and builds a canonical reference to keep coming back to.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="who">
			<h2>Who</h2>
				<p>Pattern Lab benefits everyone involved in a web project. It can serve as a glue that holds a project together.</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>Information Designers</strong>&mdash;Designing static sketches and wireframes for the multi-device Web can be challenging. Pattern Lab helps integrate modular thinking into the design process right out of the gate, and helps demonstrate responsive patterns to create.</li>
					<li><strong>Visual Designers</strong>&mdash;Visual designers can use Pattern Lab as a way to see how each module works in a responsive environment and also to keep track of all the design's raw materials.</li>
					<li><strong>Developers</strong>&mdash;Pattern Lab provides developers with an efficient system for quickly developing prototypes and final front-end code.</li>
					<li><strong>Clients and managers</strong>&mdash; can use it as a way of keeping track of everything going on the site and as an educational resource.</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="how">
				<h2>How</h2>
				<p>You can learn more about how to get started with Pattern Lab by <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php">viewing the documentation.</a></p>
			</section>

			<section id="where">
				<h2>Where</h2>
				<p>Pattern Lab should live in an environment accessible via a URL, which ensures everyone involved with the project can view the design system. Optionally (and ideally) your Pattern Lab can be published publicly like other style guides created by <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/mobile/device-considerations/philosophy">The BBC</a>, and <a href="http://pasteup.gu.com/">The Guardian</a>.</p>
