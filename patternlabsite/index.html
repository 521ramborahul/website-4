            <h2 class="section-title">What It Is</h2>
            <p class="intro">Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help you create atomic design systems.</p>
            <ul class="g g-4up">
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Static site generator</h3>
                <p>At its core, Pattern Lab is a custom static site generator that constructs an interface by stitching atoms, molecules, and organisms together to form templates and pages.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>component library</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab serves as your project's pattern library and frontend style guide, but you're simultaneously able to see components abstractly and in context.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Pattern starter kit</h3>
                 <p>Pattern Lab provides a whole slew of patterns just to get you started. <em>Don't use them all.</em> You should use Pattern Lab to create your own atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. </p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Viewport Resizer</h3>
                <p>It's our job to make sure our designs look and function beautifully across a whole slew of Web-enabled devices. Pattern Lab provides a robust viewport resizing tool to help you create great designs across all screens.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Annotation Tool</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab provides a way to annotate your interface to better communicate design and development decisions to clients and team members.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="section section-3" id="what-isnt">
            <h2 class="section-title">What It Ain't</h2>
            <p class="intro">Pattern Lab doesn't give you all the answers.</p>

            <ul class="g g-3up">
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>A UI framework</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab isn't <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. It's not <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. It's not flat. It's not skeuomorphic. We've got nothing against UI frameworks, but that's not what Pattern Lab does. How it looks and how it's coded is entirely up to you.</p>
               </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Language-dependent</h3>
                <p>Like Sass? Great! Go nuts. Use Less instead? That's cool too. Don't like preprocessors? Totally fine. Gotta have jQuery, or wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole? Pattern Lab lets you write HTML, CSS and JavaScript however you want. Write code as awesome or as crappy as you like.</p>
               </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Incredibly Rigid</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab is designed to be flexible with regards to naming and structure. There's really no One Right Way to do this, and we think that's just fine. Name things as you please, and we'll leave the hair-splitting out of things.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why</h2>
            <p class="intro">Build systems, not pages.</p>
            <div class="g g-3up">
              <div class="gi">
                <h3>The need for modularity</h3>
                <p>Component-driven design has been around for a long while now, but it's become imperative to think now that the Web landscape is so much more complex. It's essential to consider how every thing you include in an interface looks and functions across a whole slew of browsers, devices, and environments.</p>

                <h3>Tiny Bootstraps, for Every Client</h3>
                <p>In this responsive age, our <a href="http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/" rel="external">responsive deliverables</a> need to be more than an ad hoc collection of pages. Give clients a custom design system with which they can modify, extend, and grow with into the future.</p>

            <p class="intro">Pattern Lab serves as a hub for your web project.</p>
            <ul class="g g-4up">
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Information Designers</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab helps integrate modular thinking into the design process right out of the gate, and helps demonstrate responsive patterns to create.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Visual Designers</h3>
                <p>Visual designers can use Pattern Lab as a way to see how each module works in a responsive environment and also to keep track of all the design's raw materials.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Developers</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab provides developers with an efficient system for quickly developing prototypes and production-ready front-end code.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="gi">
                <h3>Clients and managers</h3>
                <p>Everyone, not just designers and developers, needs to understand the benefits of crafting a design system. Clients and managers can view the project in the browser, as a review, and as a reference.</p>
              </li>

                <h3>One URL to Rule Them All</h3>
                <p>Pattern Lab should live in an environment accessible via a URL where everyone involved with your project can view the design system. Pattern Lab can serve as a hub for your project, so make sure it's accessible.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="gi">
                <h3>Share Your Results</h3>
                <p>Optionally (and ideally) your Pattern Lab can be published publicly like other style guides created by <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/mobile/device-considerations/philosophy">The BBC</a>, and <a href="http://pasteup.guim.co.uk/index.html">The Guardian</a>. This project wouldn't exist if these organizations didn't share their knowledge and approach. Help makes things better by sharing your Pattern Lab.</p>
