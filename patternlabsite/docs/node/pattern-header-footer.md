# Modifying the Pattern Header & Footer 

To add your own assets like JavaScripts and CSS to your patterns' header and footer you can modify two files:

* `source/_patternlab-files/pattern-header-footer/header.html`
* `source/_patternlab-files/pattern-header-footer/footer.html`

These files are added to every rendered pattern, "view all" page and style guide. To see your changes simply re-generate your site.

**Disclaimer**
Be careful.
