# Modifying the Pattern Header & Footer 
When the PHP version of Pattern Lab compiles each pattern it appends a standard header and footer onto each. The header and footer can be found in:

    source/_patternlab-files/pattern-header-footer/

If you want to include a standard JavaScript library for every pattern or if you want to add a custom CSS file to each simply edit the appropriate file.

**Important:** Please refrain from removing the JavaScript in the footer. This code helps make several of the Pattern Lab features like Page Follow work properly.
