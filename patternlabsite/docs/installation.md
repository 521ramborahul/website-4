# Installation
To install the PHP version of Pattern Lab, visit the [project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php/) and either cloning the project or downloading a ZIP file of the project. All code and required libraries are distributed with the project.

Once you have the project files on your computer, you're now ready to [generate Pattern Lab for the first time](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php/wiki/Generating-the-Pattern-Lab-Website-for-the-First-Time).
