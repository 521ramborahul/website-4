    <p class="intro">There are five distinct levels in atomic design:</p>
</section>

<section class="section section-short section-2" id="atoms">
    <h2 class="section-title">Atoms</h2>
    <div class="section-wrap">
        <img src="assets/icon-atom.svg" alt="Atom"  class="section-icon" />

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>In chemistry, atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.</p>
            <p>Translated to interfaces, <strong>atoms are basic tags</strong>, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.
            </p>
            <p>Atoms are abstract and aren't often not terribly useful on their own, but they provide a useful reference and allow you to see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="section section-short section-3" id="molecules">
    <h2 class="section-title">Molecules</h2>
    <div class="section-wrap">
        <img src="assets/icon-molecule.svg" alt="Atom"  class="section-icon" />
        
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.</p>

            <p>In interfaces, molecules are <strong>groups of elements that function together as a unit</strong>. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule. </p>
            <p>Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="section section-short section-4" id="organisms">
    <h2 class="section-title">Organisms</h2>
    <div class="section-wrap">
        <img src="assets/icon-organism.svg" alt="Atom"  class="section-icon" />

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Organisms are <strong>groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.</strong> <p>Organisms can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo,  navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.</p> 
            
            <p>Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.</p>
        </div>

<section class="section section-short section-5" id="templates">
    <h2 class="section-title">Templates</h2>
    <div class="section-wrap">
        <img src="assets/icon-template.svg" alt="Atom"  class="section-icon" />

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. It’s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.
            </p>
            <p>Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms. Templates are also where clients start seeing the final design in place. In my experience working with this methodology, templates begin their life as HTML wireframes, but over time increase fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable. Bearded Studio in Pittsburgh follow <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-comping-obtaining-signoff-with-mockups" title="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-comping-obtaining-signoff-with-mockups">a similar process</a>, where designs start <a href="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/wireframes-no-mq" title="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/wireframes-no-mq">grayscale and layout-less</a> but <a href="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/wireframes" title="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/wireframes">slowly</a> <a href="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v1" title="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v1">increase</a> <a href="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v2" title="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v2">fidelity</a> until the <a href="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v5" title="http://aafh-css.heroku.com/v5">final design</a> is in place.

<section class="section section-short section-6" id="pages">
    <h2 class="section-title">Pages</h2>
    <div class="section-wrap">
        <img src="assets/icon-page.svg" alt="Atom"  class="section-icon" />

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.</p>
            <p>Pages are the highest level of fidelity and because they’re the most tangible, it’s typically where most people in the process spend most of their time and what most reviews revolve around.
            </p>
            <p>The page stage is essential as it’s where we test the effectiveness of the design system. Viewing everything in context allows us to loop back to modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address the real context of the design.
            </p>
            <p>Pages are also the place to test variations in templates. For example, you might want to articulate what a headline containing 40 characters looks like, but also demonstrate what 340 characters looks like. What does it look like when a user has one item in their shopping cart versus 10 items with a discount code applied? Again, these specific instances influence how we loop back through and construct our system. </p>
